#Given an "out" string length 4, such as "<<>>", and a word, return a new string where the word is in the middle of the out string, e.g. "<<word>>". Note: use str.substring(i, j) to extract the String starting at index i and going up to but not including index j.#

public String makeOutWord(String out, String word) {
    // we sandwich the word between the first two characters of out and the last two characters of out
    return out.substring(0, 2) + word + out.substring(2, 4);
