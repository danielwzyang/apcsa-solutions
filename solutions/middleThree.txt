#Given a string of odd length, return the string length 3 from its middle, so "Candy" yields "and". The string length will be at least 3.#

public String middleThree(String str) {
    // to find the index of the middle of the string, we divide the length by 2
        // ex: abcdefg has a length of 7
        // 7 / 2 = 3; the character at index 3 is d, which is the middle

    int mid = str.length() / 2;

    // we start at the character before the middle and the end point is two characters after the middle because it's exclusive
    return str.substring(mid - 1, mid + 2);
