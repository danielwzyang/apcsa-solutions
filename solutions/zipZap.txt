#Look for patterns like "zip" and "zap" in the string -- length-3, starting with 'z' and ending with 'p'. Return a string where for all such words, the middle letter is gone, so "zipXzap" yields "zpXzp".#

public String zipZap(String str) {
    // if our string is less than 3 characters long, then it cannot match the pattern
    if (str.length() < 3) {

    for (int i = 0; i < str.length(); i++) {
        // for every character we pass, we add it to our result
        res += str.charAt(i);

        // this code checks to see if we're at the z of the pattern z_p
        // i needs to be less than str.length() - 2 because that's the last possible valid substring
        // anything past that is too short to be z_p
        // the character we're at also needs to be z and the character after the next one has to be p
        if (i < str.length() - 2 && str.charAt(i) == 'z' && str.charAt(i + 2) == 'p') {
            // if all of this is true then we skip the next character so we don't add it to our result
            // we do this by increasing our index
            i++;
