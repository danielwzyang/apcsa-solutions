#We want to make a row of bricks that is goal inches long. We have a number of small bricks (1 inch each) and big bricks (5 inches each). Return true if it is possible to make the goal by choosing from the given bricks. This is a little harder than it looks and can be done without any loops.#

public boolean makeBricks(int small, int big, int goal) {
    // the two ways that this could fail is if we don't have enough bricks or we don't have enough small bricks
    // the total length of our bricks is big * 5 + small
    // the number of small bricks we need is the goal % 5 since the rest is filled with big bricks
    return (goal <= big * 5 + small) && (goal % 5 <= small);
